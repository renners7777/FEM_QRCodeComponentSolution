## Overview

- This is my first challenge with Frontend Mentor. I have been learning backend for a few months now and, as a software engineer in my first year of coding, wanted to see how much I could remember from my earlier learning.

## My process

- It has been a while since I have actually written any html or css code so, in order to get my head into gear, I looked at all the Frontend Mentor files in the directory and considered the different elements of the code.
- I started with the html elements and made the decision to use a card structure for the main section.
- I decided to use Flexbox as this seems the best fit for this task, which largely consisted of centering all elements on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about the intricacies of Flexbox so will keep coming back to this topic as required.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This has always been a great resource and I hadn't used Flexbox for a while so I used it to refresh my memory.
